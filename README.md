     - [ ] Your project must be developed using Git and GitHub. For each implemented requirement, make a commit with a descriptive message of what you have evolved.
     - [ ] All screens must be implemented in a single HTML file. If you prefer, for organization purposes, you can split your JavaScript/CSS into multiple files.

     - [ ] The quiz score (percentage of correct answers over total questions) must be calculated in the *front*, without any communication with the server, as well as the ranking of which level the user was based on this score.
     - [ ] The title, image and description of the level that the user got should be displayed.
     - [ ] The *score* must be rounded so as not to have decimal places.

         - Screen 3.2: Quizz questions.

             - [ ] Number of levels: at least 2 levels.
         - quiz questions

        - [ ] If any validation fails, an alert should be displayed asking the user to fill in the data correctly. For simplicity, it is not mandatory to inform which validation failed.
        - [ ] When finishing the creation of the quiz and saving it on the server, the user should see **Screen 3.4: Success of the quiz**. On this screen, he can click on the quiz (or on the "Access Quizz" button) to view the created quiz (Screen 2) or go back to home (Screen 1).
        - [ ] When the user returns home (either immediately or later), it should update the listed quizzes to include the newly created quiz.
        - User quizzes
             - [ ] When creating a quiz on the server, it will return the complete object of the quiz created as a response, including the id (unique identifier) that the server generated for this quiz.
             - [ ] In order to be able to differentiate a user-created quiz from other quizzes in the future, you can store these ids when creating the quiz.

                 ðŸ”¥ **Tip**: For this, you'll use a JavaScript feature called *Local Storage*. We have prepared an article to help you with this:

                 [Article: How to store data on user's computer? (LocalStorage)](https://www.notion.so/Artigo-Como-armazenar-dados-no-computador-do-usu-rio-LocalStorage-c5c124921bec4bd583d98f5f9da061dd)

             - [ ] On **Screen 1: List of quizzes**, you can compare the id of the quizzes coming from the server with these ids stored in the creation of the quizzes to verify if a certain quizz was created by the user in question.
